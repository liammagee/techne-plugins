# Room: Entrance Hall

You stand in a grand entrance hall. The air is musty with age, and flickering torchlight casts dancing shadows on the stone walls.

Three passages branch off from here.

## Description

The ceiling arches high above you, lost in shadow. Ancient tapestries line the walls, depicting scenes of philosophical discourse among bearded scholars.

A brass plaque on the wall reads:

> "Know thyself, and you shall know the universe."
